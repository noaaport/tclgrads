This is the first release of Tclgrads, a library of Tcl procedures
to execute GrADS commands from a Tcl script.  Tclgrads uses Expect to
connect, send the commands to GrADS and parse its output,
and it requires some of the modules of the Tcllib. There are no other
requirements, and in particular it is a pure Tcl library so there is
nothing to compile.

Sources and documentation are available from the OpenGrADS project

	http://www.opengrads.org

at SourceForge, and binary packages for FreeBSD and CentOS, in tbz and rpm
formats, respectively, are available from the software section in

	http://www.noaaport.net

Since Tclgrads is written entirely in Tcl, the packages can be
installed anywhere the same package management tools are used.

The distribution comes with a set of examples to illustrate the
basic functionality, and with a README file that list the available
procedures and their usage. The packages install the examples and README
under

	<PREFIX>/share/doc/tclgrads

where <PREFIX> is /usr (CentOS) or /usr/local (FreeBSD).
