Overview
========

**TclGrads** is a library of *Tcl* procedures to execute *GrADS* commands
from a Tcl script. TclGrads uses the Tcl open command to connect,
send the commands to GrADS and parse its output, and it requires
some of the modules of the Tcllib. There are no other requirements,
and in particular it is a pure Tcl library so there is nothing to
compile.
