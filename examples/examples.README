With the exception of "ex-nbsp.tcl", the examples require the data files

	yq.grb
	yq.ctl
	yq.idx

If they are not in this directory, they must be copied from the "src/test"
directory to this one. The Package installation do this automatically.

The file "ex-nbsp.tcl" is an example for using the library with
the data files processed the Nbsp (see the nbsp.README file for details).
