- Requirements

  The following are required and must be installed:

    Tcllib

- Installing from Packages

  Binary packages exist for FreeBSD (tbz) and CentOS (rpm). Since tclgrads
  is written entirely in tcl and no compilation is involved, the rpm
  packages should work anywhere rpm is the package management tool.

  The packages are available from the software section in

	http://www.noaaport.net

  which can be installed with the native package management tools (e.g.,
  rpm, pkg_add).

- Installation using the Makefile

  This boils down to executing

	./configure.sh
	make install-dirs
	make install

  inside the ``tclgrads'' distribution directory.

- Manual installation

  Tclgrads is written entirely in tcl, so there is no compilation
  involved. The package consists of a single file ``grads.tcl''
  and the accompanying index file ``pkgIndex.tcl''.

  Perhaps the best option is to create a directory ``tclgrads'' at the same
  as the tcllib directory, and put both of the above files in that
  directory.

  The files can be saved anywhere, for example

	/usr/local/lib/tcl_site

  A script that will use the package can then add the line

	lappend auto_path "/usr/local/lib/tcl_site"

  before the ``package require grads'' and it will be found.
