This file explains how to use the tclgrads-based scripts with the grib data
files processed by Nbsp (Noaaport Broadcast System Processor).

First the ``gribfilter'' must be enabled in the Nbsp configuration
file ``features.conf'':

set features(gribfilter) 1;

Then in the ``gribfilter.conf'' configuration file, set

set gribfilter(gradsctlenable)  1;

With this setting the ``control'' files that are required by GrADS are
generated automatically (the gribfilter.README in the nbsp distribution
for more details of what happens behind the scenes.)

The control files that Nbsp generates are in the directory

	/var/noaaport/data/grib/ctl

and then in subdirectories by model and run; for example, the file

	/var/noaaport/data/grib/ctl/gfs/2008092006/2008092006_gfs_yqa.ctl

corresponds to a GFS run on 2008092006 (the gribfilter.README in the nbsp
distribution for the naming conventions.)

Example 1 -
=======

The following script will produce a temperature-wind plot from this file:
==============================================================================
#!/usr/local/bin/tclsh8.4

package require grads;

set ctl "/var/noaaport/data/grib/ctl/gfs/2008092006/2008092006_gfs_yqa.ctl";
::grads::init;

::grads::open $ctl;

::gradsu::display "skip(ugrdprs,3);skip(vgrdprs,3);tmpprs";
::gradsu::draw "title Wind/Temp";
::gradsu::printim uvt.png;

::grads::end;
==============================================================================

Example 2 -
=======

The following slightly more complicated script will produce a similar plot
for each file in the ``/var/noaaport/data/grib/ctl/gfs/2008092006''
directory:
==============================================================================
#!/usr/local/bin/tclsh8.4

package require grads;

set dir "/var/noaaport/data/grib/ctl/gfs/2008092006";
set flist [glob -directory $dir *yq*.ctl];

::grads::init;

foreach f $flist {
    ::grads::open $f;

    ::gradsu::times times;
    set date [lindex $times 1];

    ::gradsu::display "skip(ugrdprs,3);skip(vgrdprs,3);tmpprs";
    ::gradsu::draw "title Wind/Temp $date";
    ::gradsu::printim uvt-$date.png;

    ::gradsu::reinit;
}

::grads::end;
==============================================================================

Needless to say, each file contains the data for several variables and
at various levels and many more plots can be generated from each file.
But the idea is the same: the gribfilter takes care of generating
the required GrADS control files, and the scripts just need to
``grads::open'' the appropriate one.
